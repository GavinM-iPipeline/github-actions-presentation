# This repository is going to be archived (aka read-only) and will no longer be updated. I am moving all of this content and creating new content at https://github.com/devopselvis/github-actions-presentation.

# This move allows me access to more functionality, allowing for even better demos. So if you have forked this repo, starred it, or follow it, please come do the same at https://github.com/devopselvis/github-actions-presentation.

# The migration should be finished in a few days.
